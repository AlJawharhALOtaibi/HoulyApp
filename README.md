## Overview

Houly is a mobile application developed in Swift, designed to facilitate delivery services on foot. It serves as a platform that connects people in need of small deliveries with individuals willing to provide these services in return for compensation. This app streamlines the process of exchanging goods or items within a local area, promoting a community-based delivery system.

### Key Features

- **Delivery on Foot:** Houly focuses on foot-based deliveries, allowing users to request or provide delivery services for nearby locations.
- **Connecting People:** The app acts as a bridge between those seeking small deliveries and individuals interested in fulfilling these requests.
- **Money Aid for Delivery Persons:** Users offering delivery services receive compensation for their contributions, encouraging participation within the community.
- **Ease of Use:** The user interface is intuitive, making it simple for both requesters and delivery persons to navigate the app's functionalities.
- **Location-based Services:** Leveraging location services, the app ensures efficient matching between requests and nearby delivery persons.

## How It Works

1. **Registration:** Users create an account, specifying whether they want to request a delivery or provide delivery services.
2. **Requesting a Delivery:** Individuals seeking deliveries can post their requirements, including the item, pickup and drop-off locations, and any specific instructions.
3. **Providing Delivery Services:** Users interested in making deliveries can browse available requests in their vicinity and choose the ones they wish to fulfill.
4. **Accepting and Completing Requests:** Once a delivery person accepts a request, they pick up the item and deliver it to the specified location within the agreed-upon timeframe.
5. **Payment and Ratings:** Upon successful delivery, the requester makes the payment through the app, and both parties have the option to rate each other based on their experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Swift Programming Language:** The app is developed using Swift for iOS devices, ensuring a seamless and responsive user experience.
- **Location Services:** Utilizes device location to match delivery requests with nearby delivery persons efficiently.
- **Payment Integration:** Integrates payment gateways to facilitate secure and convenient transactions within the app.
